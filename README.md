Learning Objectives
Use useEffect hook with a dependency array to retrieve data when a component first mounts
Use useState to manage component state
Use custom hooks to bundle together multiple useState & useEffect calls
Use the Supabase Javascript client to retrieve data from a database
Use the network tab to examine (and debug) the request being sent to a server and the response received from a server
Use the async/await pattern to make our asynchronous code easier to read
Description
There is a database provided to you that contains all the countries in the world. Your goal is to query that data using the Supabase Javascript client and then the `useEffect` hook to display the data. You should also use the flagpedia API to load each country's flag. The API uses the 2 character ISO code to identify countries which is saved in the `iso2` column of the database. Finally, your app should allow users to filter by continent, and search by name.

Acceptance Criteria
Must use the Supabase client to get the list of countries
Must use the `useEffect` hook to call the service layer to get the list of countries
Users should see a list of all the countries of the world with their flag
Users should be able to filter by continent
Rubric
Required for grading: Main branch deployed to Netlify, and open PR from dev branch to Netlify with deploy preview

Task Points
`fetchCountries` function in services folder gets list of countries from Supabase 4
useEffect correctly loads the list of countries when the `Main` component renders 4
useEffect uses a try / catch block to display an error if the API call fails 4
useEffect / useState moved into a custom useCountries component 4
Users can filter by continent 4
Stretch (up to 3 points)
Add a loading state (+1)
Allow users to query by country name (+1)
Allow users to sort by name (+1)
